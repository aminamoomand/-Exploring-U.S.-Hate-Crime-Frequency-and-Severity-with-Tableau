# Exploring U.S. Hate Crime Frequency and Severity with Tableau

## Overview
This project analyzes FBI-reported hate crime data across the United States to explore which regions experience the most frequent and most severe hate crimes. Using Tableau, the analysis focuses on aggregated, descriptive insights through interactive dashboards rather than predictive modeling or policy interpretation.

## Data Analyst
Amina Moomand

## Client/Sponsor
Independent Portfolio Project

## Purpose
To identify trends, regional differences, and severity levels of hate crimes across the U.S. using visual analytics. The goal is to clearly communicate key insights through Tableau dashboards, highlighting patterns in frequency, offense type, and bias motivation over time.

## Scope of Work (SOW)
The full Statement of Work detailing project scope, activities, and deliverables is available here: [SOW](SOW.pdf)

## Tools and Technologies
- Tableau – Data visualization and dashboard creation  
- Excel – Data consolidation and cleaning  
- Python / Pandas (optional) – For preprocessing and data wrangling  
- GitHub – Version control and portfolio hosting  

## How to Reproduce
1. Download the data from the [UCR Hate Crime Statistics](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/hate-crime) portal and export multiple year files as `.xlsx`.  
2. Clean and prepare the data: merge files, remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize column names, and save as `Hate_Crime_Cleaned.xlsx`.  
3. Load the dataset into Tableau and recreate visuals: line charts for yearly trends, bar charts for single vs. multiple offenses, and a map visualization for state-level comparisons.  
4. Customize dashboards (colors, tooltips) and publish to Tableau Public.
